## 🔗 Live Demo

👉 https://car-price-ai.streamlit.app/

Try different combinations of:

- Car Company
- Model
- Year
- Fuel Type
- Kilometres Driven

## ⚙ How It Works

1️⃣ **Data Collection**  
The model is trained using a cleaned dataset of used car listings.

2️⃣ **Feature Engineering**  
Key features include:

- Car Name
- Company
- Year
- Fuel Type
- Kilometres Driven

3️⃣ **Preprocessing Pipeline**

- OneHotEncoding for categorical features
- Numerical feature handling

4️⃣ **Model Training**

A regression model learns pricing patterns from historical data.

5️⃣ **Prediction**

User inputs → Model inference → Estimated price output.
